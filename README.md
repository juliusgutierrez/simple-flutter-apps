Discussion Points

Functional Account Setup

Identify and create a functional account to be used for accessing Innova remote servers.

The account will be added to a specific Active Directory (AD) group to control access.

The AD group membership defines the access rights (read/write permissions).

Security and Maintenance

Implement an interactive setup where the password must change every 3 months.

Access is temporary and should only remain active as long as necessary.

Ensure that read/write access is granted on a temporary basis for enhanced security.

Naming Convention

Follow the naming standard for AD groups to maintain consistency and easy identification.

AD groups linked to this functional account must adhere to organizational naming conventions.

Temporary Resources

Clarified that functional accounts, AD groups, and servers used for this setup are all temporary in nature.

Regular reviews should be conducted to ensure no unnecessary active access persists.

Consultation

Further guidance and validation will be sought from Sir Chipoy regarding the implementation details and compliance requirements.
