Completed the Ingenium special report and awaiting SF API for integration.

While waiting, identified a report format issue and held a discussion with the Business Unit (BU).

BU confirmed the report is no longer in use. While the batch continues to execute, it does not generate the expected output, as it turned out BU had already stopped using it.

Currently coordinating with BU to secure sign-off for retiring this batch, along with 3 additional batches.

Retirement of these 4 batches will:

Save approximately 45% of processing resources.

Reduce the number of monitored batches for the AOS team.
